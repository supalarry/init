~/.ssh/authorized_keys file contains
public keys of users that can connect
to remote server via SSH. Server
then encrypts a message using public key
pointed out by the user. Using that key
text is encrypted, and it can be decrypted
only with private key. In addition to text,
session ID is added to create a hash value
that is sent back to server. If hash value
is the value of the text and ID, then the device
connecting to remote server is authorised.
