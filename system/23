In addition to using useradd, it is possible
to go to settings, Users and then add user.
Using ssh session, for example, to add a new
user to a remote server, administrator needs
to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config folder. As root,
sshd_config file should be appended port number
to which SSH is listening for user to connect.
Furthermore, using AllowUsers, we can list which
IP is allowed to log in.
