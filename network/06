To obtain IP address of DNS server in command line, 
you must write host -a domain.com | grep from.
host performs DNS lookup, translating domain name
into a dotted decimal IP address or vice versa.
To fulfill this request, host uses IP address of
name server listed in /etc/resolv.conf to connect
to a name server and find IP address of a domain
name. To view IP address of name server resolving
domain name to IP, write cat /etc/resolv.conf.
