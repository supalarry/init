When using traceroute to connect to slash16.org,
it can be seen that first two IP addresses are
local. It is indicated by the fact that they both
start with 10. Three groups of private IPs are
IPs that start with 10, 172.16 to 172.31 or 192.168.
In this case, 10.11.1.254 is IP of a router and then
another device has IP of 10.60.1.1., which could be
NAT to translate local IP into a public IP.
